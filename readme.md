Code sample to create classes for SQL-Server tables in a specific database.

Base code from a [Stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5873170/generate-class-from-database-table) to a response for a [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68225326/how-to-create-a-models-class-from-sql-server).

**Important** The query in ClassQuery.txt has a hard coded attribute `JsonProperty` which most likely will not be what most developers would be insterested in so you may want to modifiy the query.

To try out the code with the database setup in code, use the following [script](https://gist.github.com/karenpayneoregon/40a6e1158ff29819286a39b7f1ed1ae8).


- [x] Written for C#9, .NET Core - minor changes to use in .NET Framework classic
- [x] No guarantees that the code fits all situations
