Code sample to create classes for SQL-Server tables in a specific database.

Base code from a [Stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5873170/generate-class-from-database-table) to a response for a [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68225326/how-to-create-a-models-class-from-sql-server).

**Important** The query in ClassQuery.txt has a hard coded attribute `JsonProperty` which most likely will not be what most developers would be insterested in so you may want to modifiy the query.
